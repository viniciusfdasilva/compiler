; The timings reported by pairs of rdpmc instructions are quite sensitive to the exact position
; that lfence appears. Two back to back lfences execute more quickly than expected compared to
; two lfences separated by a single 1-cycle insruction; adding the 1 cycle instruction increases
; the measured time by about 4 cycles. The next few instrutions also generally measure "too high"
; with this approach. So it is best to compare not against a totally empty function, but against
; one with a few instructions, with the method-under-test also having those few instructions.
